        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
            Nature Vision AI is an image interpretation system that allows users to upload a photo and receive a generated description of the image’s content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application uses OpenAI’s CLIP vision-language model (hosted on Hugging Face) to analyze visual features and translate them into natural language.
        </p>

    <section id="use-case">
        <h3>Designed for outdoor explorers</h3>
        <p>
            Users can upload images of trees, rocks, plants, flowers, landscapes or animals from hikes, parks, forests, beaches, or any natural environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system then provides descriptive output to help people identify + learn about what they are seeing in the wild.
        </p>

    <section id="goal">
        <h3>Why are we building this?</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to demonstrate how modern AI, specifically vision-language models like CLIP, can interpret real-world environments and express them in human language.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to show how AI can make nature more understandable, accessible, and educational.
